# RISC-V Emulator

**This is a learning project and not suited for production use.**

## Overview

This is a RISC-V emulator written in Rust.

It is based off the code from [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP29wDx6QmW4sXTvFYgbHrLygqH8_oNEH) that builds it in TypeScript.

## Development

In addition to Rust, you will need to install the following:

- [Node/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [xpack](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack/docs/install/)
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

To bootstrap the project:

```sh
just bootstrap
```

Run `just` to see all available commands.
